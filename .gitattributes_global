#
# Git Attributes Some of these settings can also be specified for a path, so that Git applies
# those settings only for a subdirectory or subset of files. These path-specific settings are
# called Git attributes and are set either in a .gitattributes file in one of your directories
# (normally the root of your project) or in the .git/info/attributes file if you donâ€™t want the
# attributes file committed with your project.
